Dear User,

Hello and welcome to the innovative recipe website, the most cutting-edge version available today! 🎉

Upon entering the site, you'll see random recipes available, but you won’t be able to access more until you register. On the homepage, you can navigate to the registration screen, or if you are already registered, you can go to the login screen.

Once logged in, you will have access to several innovative and user-friendly features to enjoy the platform to the fullest. Of course, we welcome any suggestions or issues you may have—feel free to contact us via email. Wondering how? Use the "About" button in the top toolbar to learn more about us, view our other projects, and get in touch.

What does the site offer you? Here’s what you can do:

• View random recipes available on the site.

• See the three most recent recipes you viewed on the main screen upon logging in.

• Use the search screen to find recipes by name, type, and other filters you can discover yourself, with options to sort by likes or preparation time.

• Upload your own recipes to a separate screen for personal storage, in addition to saving them on the site for other users.

• Upload family recipes, specify who the recipe belongs to and when it is typically prepared, with these also saved to a separate screen for you.

• Like different recipes on the site, and there’s also a separate screen for your favorite recipes. 
** Quite convenient so far, right? 😮

** But that’s not all! What else? -

• For each recipe, you can see whether you’ve viewed it before by an emoji on the recipe itself.

• The recipe will display general details such as preparation time, number of likes, whether you’ve viewed it, and whether it’s vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.

• Click on a recipe to access a dedicated screen for that specific recipe, where you can see preliminary details, a brief summary, ingredients, and preparation instructions—allowing you to enjoy and replicate the recipe at home in an organized manner.

• All of this will be permanently saved to your personal account, even if you log out and back in—simply amazing!

In summary, the new platform is still in development, but demand led us to release it early. We will continue to improve it so you can enjoy it and find it meets all your needs!

We wish you enjoyable and convenient use, and now, it’s your turn to tell your friends about it! 😊🔝
